## ðŸ“‹ PROJECT OVERVIEW

**Margarita's Tailoring Helper** is a web app that assists Margarita LeÃ³n, a non-fluent English speaking clothing designer and tailor from Utah, with a common inconvenience language barriers may pose.

### **Target Audience:**
- Margarita LeÃ³n and other tailors with some level of language limitations.
- Spanish speaking or Utah clients needing tailoring services.
- Immigrants and other non-English speaking members of our community who just want to book an appointment and establish communication effortlessly.

### **Major Problem?** 
Language barriers in the tailoring service industry (automatic language translation and simple user interface).
